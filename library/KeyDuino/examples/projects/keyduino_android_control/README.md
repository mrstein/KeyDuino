##Â Dependency

This sketch is made to be used with KeyDuino mobile application, for demonstration purposes.  
It works with [bblanchon's ArduinoJson library](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson/releases).  

If you encounter troubles using it with an older Arduino IDE version, [this ArduinoJson version](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson/releases/download/v5.0.7/ArduinoJson-v5.0.7-old-layout.zip) may work better.  

Please note that you don't need this for NFC P2P in general ; we simply decided to use JSON to ease communication of pin numbers, etc.
